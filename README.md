> ### Angular codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://angular.realworld.io)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged application built with Angular that interacts with an actual backend server including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Angular Styleguide](https://angular.io/styleguide) & best practices.

Additionally, there is an Angular 1.5 version of this codebase that you can [fork](https://github.com/gothinkster/angularjs-realworld-example-app) and/or [learn how to recreate](https://thinkster.io/angularjs-es6-tutorial).
